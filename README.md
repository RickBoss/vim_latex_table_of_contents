# Latex Table of Contents for your VIM Editor

## A useful tool for academic researchers who use VIM and also use Latex, but are hesitant about editing Latex files in VIM because they miss the table of contents feature that GUI based editors like texmaker provide.

### No need to install any plugin! 

### Instalation

1. Just paste the code in the .vimrc file above in your own .vimrc file

2. Then when in normal mode, you can type :LatexTree

3. If you have created any \section, \subsection or \subsubsection, when you save the file, it will automatically create the table of contents (the save option can be enabled or disabled in the code, I use it to save time so I can always get an updated table of contents everytime I save my Latex file).

4. The table of contents will appear below the latex file you are editing (if you have multiple tex files in the same folder it will also show its contents, so to avoid confusion I suggest you keep only one tex file in your folder, but it is smart enough to tell you which file the section belongs too).

### Very useful! I use it all the time when writing papers, as it allows me to easily navigate between sections, subsections and subsubsections

#### Sections and subsections are beautifully indented.
